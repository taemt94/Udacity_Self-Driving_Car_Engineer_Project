# Localization Result
- The localization results using ICP and NDT matching algorithm are under below.
- In the both videos, the blue point cloud is the given m ap and the red point cloud is from the vehicle's LiDAR.
Using these point cloud, the algorithm localize the ego vehicle.
- The green box is the true bounding box of the ego vehicle and the red box is the estimated bounding box from localization algorithm.
- You can also find the distance, the pose error of current step, and the max error of entire driving while the vehicle drives.
