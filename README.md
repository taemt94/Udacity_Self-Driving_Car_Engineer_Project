# Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer

## Introduction
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program is one of the prominent programs in Udacity that provides skills and techniques used by self-driving car teams at the most advanced technology companies in the world. 

By this program, I have learnt the techniques that power self-driving cars across the full stack of a vehicleâ€™s autonomous capabilities. Specifically, there are 5 courses, which are *Computer Vision, Sensor Fusion, Localization, Planning* and *Control*. During each course, I learnt the basic theory of each technology and completed one or more projects. In this repository, I organized all projects and the brief explanation is under below.

## Project 1. Object Detection in an Urban Environment

- This project is to train deep learning models for object detection using Waymo dataset, which is the real world dataset.
By this project, I could practice how to use Tensorflow Object Detection API and train different types of deep learning models under various hyperparameters to improve detection performance on the Waymo dataset.
- You can find the analysis of the dataset and the training results at [this page](./1_Object_Detection_in_an_Urban_Environment/submission.md).
- Main Tools : Python, Tensorflow

## Project 2-1. 3D Object Detection

- In this project, a deep-learning approach is used to detect vehicles in LiDAR data based on a birds-eye view perspective of the 3D point-cloud. Also, a series of performance measures is used to evaluate the performance of the detection approach.
- You can find the write-up of this project including the detection results and metrics plot [here](./2_Sensor_fusion/1_Mid-Term_Project_3D_Object_Detection/student/writeup.md).
- Main Tools : Python, Pytorch

## Project 2-2. Sensor Fusion and Object Tracking

- In this project, I could learn how to fuse measurements from LiDAR and camera and track vehicles over time. Using real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, the algorithm detects objects in 3D point clouds and applies an extended Kalman filter for sensor fusion and tracking over time, based on the lidar detections fused with camera detections. Data association and track management are implemented as well.
- The tracking result and answers for writeup questions are [here](./2_Sensor_fusion/2_Final_Project_Sensor_Fusion_and_Object_Detection/writeup.md).
- Main Tools : Python, Pytorch


## Project 3. Localization

## Project 4. Motion Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles

## Project 5. Control and Trajectory Tracking for Autonomous Vehicles
